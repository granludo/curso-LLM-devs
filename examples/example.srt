00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello and welcome to a Top Gear special.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That is Resolute, the most northerly town in Canada, way in the Arctic Circle.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And we're here because we're going to have a race.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
400 miles over mostly frozen ocean in that direction to the North Pole.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I shall be travelling using traditional methods.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Husky dogs, sledge and skis.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, and I'm going to try and beat him in a car.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now that's never been done before.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No one has ever tried to drive to the North Pole.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And here's why.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
On the way he would encounter ice boulders as big as cathedrals.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Polar bears the size of hatchbacks.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Temperatures that would freeze the fuel in his tank.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And if Al Gore is to be believed, open water into which he would sink.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Victory then would be mine.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right, time to meet my team.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The engines powering me to the pole would be ten husky dogs.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Where the car would get stuck or crash through the thin ice, they'd be fine.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And driving them would be Mattie McNair, one of the world's leading sled dog explorers and racers.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Dogs have been living up here for 4,000 years.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They can go through anything.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They can go through cold, they can go through blizzard.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have a lead dog that can find the hard packed ice and go through it like that.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He figures out a good route.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So hang on, that's terrain, weather, they're made for.
